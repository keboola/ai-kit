# Developer Plugin

A comprehensive toolkit for developers including specialized agents for code review, security analysis, and code quality management.

## 🤖 Available Agents

### Code Reviewer
**Command**: `@code-reviewer`
**Color**: 🟢 Green

Expert code reviewer for bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and project guidelines compliance. Uses confidence-based filtering (≥80%) to report only high-priority issues.

**Use cases:**
- Review code before pull requests
- Check adherence to project conventions (CLAUDE.md)
- Identify bugs and security issues
- Ensure code quality standards

---

### Security Agent
**Command**: `@code-security`
**Color**: 🔴 Red

Pragmatic application security engineer for multi-language code review with automated scanner integration.

**Features:**
- Cross-language security analysis (Python, Go, PHP, JavaScript, etc.)
- Automated security scanning (bandit, gosec, semgrep, npm audit, etc.)
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- CWE/CVE identification with actionable fixes

**Use cases:**
- Security audits before deployment
- Check for common vulnerabilities
- Audit dependencies for CVEs
- Track security posture over time

---

### Code Mess Detector
**Command**: `@code-mess-detector`
**Color**: 🟡 Yellow

Analyzes code written during rapid prototyping ("vibe-coding") for common quality issues. Generates detailed reports for systematic cleanup.

**Detects:**
- Inconsistent naming and poor structure
- Missing error handling and documentation
- Code duplication and magic numbers
- Dead code and debug statements
- TODO/FIXME comments

**Output:**
- JSON report: `.audit/agents/mess-detector/report.json`
- Markdown summary: `.audit/agents/mess-detector/summary.md`

**Use cases:**
- Clean up after rapid prototyping
- Identify technical debt
- Prepare code for production
- Maintain code quality

---

### Code Mess Fixer
**Command**: `@code-mess-fixer`
**Color**: 🔵 Blue

Systematically applies fixes based on code-mess-detector reports. Works through issues by priority and tracks progress.

**Features:**
- Reads detection reports and prioritizes by severity
- Applies safe, targeted fixes automatically
- Tracks progress and updates report status
- Skips complex changes requiring manual review

**Use cases:**
- Automated cleanup after detection
- Systematic technical debt reduction
- Safe refactoring with progress tracking

---

### Martin Struzsky Reviewer
**Command**: `@martin-reviewer`
**Color**: 🟣 Purple

Opinionated Python/Keboola component code reviewer modeled on Martin Struzsky's reviewing style. Focuses on architecture, configuration/client patterns, documentation consistency, and Pythonic best practices.

**Core Focus Areas:**
- Architecture and separation of concerns (component vs client vs config)
- Configuration and client initialization in `__init__`, not `run()`
- Documentation and example consistency across guides
- Modern tooling (`uv sync`, `keboola/cookiecutter-python-component`)
- Pythonic style with ruff/black formatting

**Key Principles:**
- Clients and configuration stored as instance attributes (`self.client`)
- `run()` method as clean orchestrator (< 30 lines)
- Configuration encapsulated in typed config objects
- No contradictions between documentation and code examples

**Use cases:**
- Review Keboola Python components before PRs
- Ensure adherence to component-developer guides
- Check architecture patterns and initialization
- Verify documentation consistency

## ⚡ Slash Commands

### Create PR
**Command**: `/create-pr [base-branch]`

Analyzes your changes and creates a pull request with AI-generated title and description.

**Features:**
- Analyzes commit history and diff since base branch
- Generates comprehensive PR title and description
- Automatically pushes branch if needed
- Creates PR using GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Follows conventional commit format
- Includes testing notes and breaking changes

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create PR against default branch
/create-pr

# Create PR against specific branch
/create-pr develop

# Create draft PR
/create-pr main draft
```

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Branch has commits not in base branch

---

## 🔌 MCP Servers

### Linear
Integration with Linear for issue tracking and project management.

**Features:**
- Create, read, update Linear issues
- Search and filter issues
- Manage project workflows
- Track issue status and assignments

**Setup:**
1. Plugin automatically configures the Linear MCP
2. Run `/mcp` to authenticate with Linear (OAuth)
3. Start using Linear tools in your workflow

---

## 🔐 Auto-installed Settings

Plugin automatically installs team-wide permissions via SessionStart hook:
- **Allow**: Safe git operations, read-only commands (grep, cat, ls, tree)
- **Ask**: Dangerous operations (rm, force push, package installs, docker)
- **Deny**: Access to secrets (.env, credentials, SSH keys, certificates)

**How it works:**
- Hook runs once per project on first session
- Creates `.claude/settings.json` if it doesn't exist
- Skips installation if settings already exist

**Customization:**
- Commit `.claude/settings.json` to share team permissions
- Use `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal overrides (gitignored)

## 📖 Workflows

### Code Quality Cleanup Workflow

Perfect for cleaning up after rapid prototyping sessions:

1. **Detect Issues**
   ```
   @code-mess-detector
   ```
   Analyzes your code and creates a detailed report of issues.

2. **Review Report**
   Check `.audit/agents/mess-detector/summary.md` for findings.

3. **Apply Fixes**
   ```
   @code-mess-fixer
   ```
   Systematically fixes issues from the report.

4. **Review Changes**
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```
   Review all applied fixes.

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test  # or your test command
   ```
   Verify fixes don't break functionality.

6. **Commit**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: clean up code quality issues"
   ```

### Pre-Commit Review Workflow

Ensure code quality before committing:

1. **Code Review**
   ```
   @code-reviewer
   ```
   Reviews unstaged changes for bugs and guidelines.

2. **Security Check**
   ```
   @code-security
   ```
   Scans for security vulnerabilities.

3. **Fix Issues**
   Address any high-confidence findings.

4. **Commit**
   Proceed with confidence.

### Complete Feature Development Workflow

1. **Rapid Development**
   Write your feature quickly ("vibe-coding").

2. **Detect Issues**
   ```
   @code-mess-detector
   ```
   Identify code quality issues.

3. **Apply Fixes**
   ```
   @code-mess-fixer
   ```
   Automatically fix detected issues.

4. **Review Code**
   ```
   @code-reviewer
   ```
   Ensure code meets standards.

5. **Security Check**
   ```
   @code-security

## 💡 Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Run code-reviewer before every PR
2. **Security First**: Run security checks before deployments
3. **Cleanup Regularly**: Use mess detector/fixer after prototyping sessions
4. **Track Issues**: Use Linear integration to track findings as issues
5. **Test Everything**: Always run tests after automated fixes

### When to Use Each Agent

- **code-reviewer**: Daily development, before PRs
- **code-security**: Before deployments, security audits, dependency updates
- **code-mess-detector**: After prototyping, before code review
- **code-mess-fixer**: After running detector, for automated cleanup
- **martin-reviewer**: Keboola Python components, architecture reviews, documentation consistency checks
