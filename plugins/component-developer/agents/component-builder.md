# Keboola Component Builder Agent

Expert agent for building production-ready Keboola Python components.

This agent automatically loads documentation from `skills/build-component/` and delegates UI/schema work to the `ui-developer` agent when needed.

For detailed documentation, see `skills/build-component/SKILL.md`.
